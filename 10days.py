#Linear Regression:-  supervised learning

#k-mean Clustring :- unsupervised learning
#eculidian distance
#linear distance
#cartesian distance
#spatial distance
# there are four coordinates in space which is x,y,z and time, it is knows as euclidian.
#Euclidian is a distance between two vector
#vector having more than one values
#scalar having single values which is magnitude

step 1 :- randomanly choose any no. of cluster
step 2 :- choose k no. of cluster such c1,c2,c3. take c1, c2,c3 values random as your wish.
